 This document is an unofficial working draft. The below describes
 the intended status of the specification, and not the current status
 right now.

 This document specifies CellML 1.2, an XML-based language for
 describing and exchanging mathematical models.

 This is the *normative* specification of CellML. It is intended to
 provide the minimum amount of information needed to accurately
 describe CellML. An alternative version is available that is
 annotated with much more explanatory material.
