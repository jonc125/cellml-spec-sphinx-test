Secondary specifications
========================

1. A CellML Secondary Specification SHALL be a document that places
   additional restrictions on the structure and interpretation of CellML
   Models and CellML Infosets.

2. CellML Secondary Specifications MUST NOT conflict with, or override,
   any of the assertions or requirements in this specification.

3. CellML Processing software MUST either:

   1. support one or more specific CellML Secondary Specifications, and
      correctly process all models that comply both with this
      specification and with one or more of the selected CellML
      Secondary Specifications, or,

   2. correctly process all models that comply with this specification.

4. Despite the previous paragraph, CellML Secondary Specifications MAY
   identify particular unambiguously defined subsets of all CellML
   Models as being optional for implementors, and CellML Processing
   Software MAY choose to exercise such options.
